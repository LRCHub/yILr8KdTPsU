Hey do it now yeah hey
Yeah once I was a boogie singer
playin' in a rock & roll band
I never had no problems yeah
burnin' down
the one night stands
And everything around me yeah
got to start to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly yes I did
to disco down
and check out the show
Yeah they were dancin'
and singin'
and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
somebody turned around
and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down that boogie and play
that funky music till you die
hey hey till you die yeah

I tried to understand this
I thought that they were out
of their minds
How could I be so foolish
(how could I)
To not see I was the one behind
So still I kept on fighting
Well losing every step
of the way
said I must go back there
(I got to go back)
And check to see if things
still the same
Yeah they were dancin'
and singin'
and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
somebody turned around
and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down that boogie and play
that funky music till you die
till you die yeah
wow till you die yeah
Gonna play some electified
funky music come on

Now first it wasn't easy
Changin' Rock & Roll and minds
And things were getting shaky
I thought I'd have to
leave it behind
Oh but now its so much better
(it's so much better)
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin'
(you no I won't)
Of how I learned my lesson
that day
Yeah they were dancin'
and singin'
and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
somebody turned around
and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down that boogie and play
that funky music till you die
Till you die
Oh till you die
They shouted
play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Ya Gotta keep on
playin' funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Gonna take it higher now
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music
